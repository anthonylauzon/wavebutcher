# Wavebutcher

Wavebutcher slices, trims, fades and normalizes your recording sessions.
It slices a long session audio file into parts at points of -40db silence,
trims the silence from the beginning and end of the slices, applies a 4 ms fade
to the beginning and end of the trimmed slices, and finally normalizes the
trimmed & faded slices.
